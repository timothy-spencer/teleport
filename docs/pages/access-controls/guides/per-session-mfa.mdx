title: Per-session MFA
description: Require U2F checks for user SSH and Kubernetes sessions

# Per-session MFA

Teleport supports U2F authentication on every SSH and Kubernetes "connection"
(a single `tsh ssh` or `kubectl` call). This is an advanced security feature
that protects users against compromises of their on-disk Teleport certificates.

<Admonition type="note">
  Per-session U2F checks don't apply to regular Teleport logins (`tsh login` or
  logging into the Web UI). We encourage you to enable login MFA in your SSO
  provider and/or for all [local Teleport
  users](../../admin-guide.mdx#local-connector).
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

- Installed [Teleport](../getting-started.mdx) or [Teleport Cloud](../../cloud/introduction.mdx) >= (=teleport.version=)
- [U2F configured](u2f.mdx) on this cluster
- U2F hardware device, such as Yubikey or Solokey
- Web browser that [supports U2F](https://caniuse.com/u2f) (if using SSH from
  the Teleport Web UI)

## Configuration

Per-session MFA can be enforced cluster-wide or only for some specific roles.

### Cluster-wide

To enforce U2F checks cluster-wide, update `teleport.yaml` on the Auth server
to contain:

```yaml
auth_service:
  authentication:
    # require per-session MFA cluster-wide
    require_session_mfa: yes
```

### Per role

To enforce U2F checks for a specific role, update the role to contain:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: example-role-with-mfa
spec:
  options:
    # require per-session MFA for this role
    require_session_mfa: true
  allow:
    ...
  deny:
    ...
```

Role-specific enforcement only applies when accessing SSH nodes or Kubernetes
clusters matching that role's `allow` section.

#### Roles example

Let's walk though an example of setting up per-session MFA checks for roles.

Jerry is an engineer with access to the company infrastructure. The
infrastructure is split into development and production environments. Security
engineer Olga wants to enforce MFA checks for accessing production servers.
Development servers don't require this to reduce engineers' friction.

Olga defines two Teleport roles: `access-dev` and `access-prod`:

```yaml
# access-dev.yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: access-dev
spec:
  allow:
    node_labels:
      env: dev
    kubernetes_labels:
      env: dev
  deny: {}
---
# access-prod.yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: access-prod
spec:
  options:
    # require per-session MFA for production access
    require_session_mfa: true
  allow:
    node_labels:
      env: prod
    kubernetes_labels:
      env: prod
  deny: {}
```

Olga then assigns both roles to all engineers, including Jerry.

When Jerry logs into node `dev1.example.com` (with label `env: dev`), nothing
special happens:

```sh
jerry@localhost $ tsh ssh dev1.example.com

jerry@dev1.example.com >
```

But when Jerry logs into node `prod3.example.com` (with label `env: prod`), he
gets prompted for an MFA check:

```sh
jerry@localhost $ tsh ssh prod3.example.com
Tap any security key <tap>

jerry@prod3.example.com >
```

If per-session MFA was enabled cluster-wide, Jerry would be prompted for MFA
even when logging into `dev1.example.com`.

## Limitations

Current limitations for this feature are:

- U2F devices aren't currently supported in `tsh` on Windows.
- Only `tsh ssh` supports per-session U2F authentication for SSH (OpenSSH `ssh`
  does not).
- Only `kubectl` supports per-session U2F authentication for Kubernetes.
- Database and Application access clients don't support per-session U2F
  authentication yet, although cluster and role configuration applies to them.
  If you enable per-session U2F checks cluster-wide, you will not be able to
  use Database or Application access. We're working on integrating per-session
  U2F checks for these clients.
