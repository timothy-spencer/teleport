## What is Teleport

Teleport is a Certificate Authority and an Access Plane for your infrastructure.
With Teleport you can:

- Set up single sign-on and have one place to access your SSH servers, Kubernetes, Databases, and Web Apps.
- Use your favorite programming language to define access policies to your infrastructure.
- Share and record interactive sessions across all environments.

## What Makes Teleport Different

- Teleport replaces legacy keys and shared secrets with short-lived X.509 and SSH certificates
  for services and users.
- It proxies and inspects SSH, Kubernetes, Web, and Database protocols.
  For example for SSH, it controls the session from the start
  and captures a session recording and in-kernel system calls using BPF.
- It removes a need for VPN and can connect multiple regions and organizations
  in a decentralized network using mutual TLS and SSH tunnels.

## Popular Use-Cases

Here are some of the most popular use-cases for Teleport:

- Use short lived certificates instead of static keys for SSH, Kubernetes, Databases, and Web Apps.
- Gather structured events and session recording/replay for `ssh` and `kubectl`.
- Centralized SSH and Kubernetes Certificate Authority.
- Enforce 2nd factor auth with U2F or TOTP.
- Connect to computing resources located behind firewalls or without static IPs.
- Collaboratively troubleshoot issues through [session sharing](user-manual.mdx#sharing-sessions).
- Discover online servers and Docker containers within a cluster with [dynamic node labels](admin-guide.mdx#labeling-nodes-and-applications).
- Capture sessions and manage certificates for existing [OpenSSH fleet](openssh-teleport.mdx).
- Secure access to internal web applications and services with [application access](./application-access/introduction.mdx).

## Teleport Enterprise

Teleport Enterprise is built around the open-source core in Teleport Open Source,
with the added benefits of role-based access control (RBAC) and easy
integration with identity managers for single sign-on (SSO).

- [Teleport Enterprise Introduction](enterprise/introduction.mdx) - Overview of the additional capabilities of Teleport Enterprise.
- [Teleport Enterprise Quick Start](enterprise/quickstart-enterprise.mdx) - A quick tutorial to show off the basic capabilities of Teleport Enterprise.
  A good place to start if you want to jump right in.
- [SSO for SSH](enterprise/sso/ssh-sso.mdx) - Overview on how Teleport Enterprise works with external identity providers for single sign-on (SSO).

Teleport is available through the free, open source edition ("Teleport Community Edition")
or a commercial edition ("Teleport Enterprise Edition").

## Operating System Support

Teleport is officially supported on the platforms listed below. It is worth noting
that the open source community has been successful in building and running Teleport on
UNIX variants other than Linux \[1].

| Operating System | Teleport Client | Teleport Server |
| - | - | - |
| Linux v2.6+ | yes | yes |
| MacOS v10.12+ | yes | yes |
| Windows \[2] | yes \[2] | no |

\[1] *Teleport is written in Go and it's possible to build it on
any OS supported by the [Golang toolchain](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/MinimumRequirements)*.

\[2] *Teleport server does not run on Windows yet, but `tsh` (the Teleport client)
can be used on Windows to execute `tsh login` to retrieve a user's SSH
certificate and use it with `ssh`, the OpenSSH client, running on a Windows client machine.*
