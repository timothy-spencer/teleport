# Application Access

Teleport Application Access is designed to provide secure access to
internal dashboards and applications, such as:

- Internal control panels.
- Wikis / tooling that're available only when connected to a VPN.
- Infrastructure dashboards, such as Kubernetes or Grafana.
- Developer tools, such as Jenkins, Gitlab, or Opsgenie.

## Example Legacy Apps

A load balancer might display network telemetry through 
a control panel but might lack the ability to authenticate with 
and be accessed by resources outside your private newtork.

Teleport let's team members access these resources securely, even outside a private network:

- Team members can access private resources securely using certificates and SSH tunnels.
- No sharing of resource secrets, passwords, or credentials.
- All interactions with any connected resource can be monitored, logged, and tracked.
- Now, private resources can securely communicate with other resources that aren't on the network.

Other common legacy app scenarios:

- An internal admin tool.
- Control panel for networking devices.

## Example Modern Apps

Teleport Application Access also supports modern web applications such as internal web
tools and infrastructure software:

- Kubernetes Dashboard.
- Grafana.
- Jupyter notebooks.
- In-house Single Page Apps (SPA).
- SPA with custom JSON Web Token support (JWT).
